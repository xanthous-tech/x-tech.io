- question: How do we start a project?
  answer: If you would like us to help you solve your problems, please feel free to reach out, and we can have as many conversations/conference meetings as needed for both of us to find out what the actual issues are. Then we will take our time to evaluate together on the possible solutions we can try to solve. Once we land on a plan with what exactly we are building, how many of us it takes, how long it takes to finish, and finally get all the logistics cleared out, we start our development phase.
- question: How do we collaborate during the development phase?
  answer: We use modern tools to ensure transparency (tasks and progress via Trello, IM via Slack/Wechat, source code via GitHub/GitLab, but most importantly, a *working* demo at all times, so you can constantly visualize the progress), and fluidity (being able to visualize progress meaning that we can cater to some amount of change on a weekly basis) during the entire development process. We do whatever it takes to keep this remote collaboration smooth, and make it to the timeline we want. Time is essence in the startup world.
